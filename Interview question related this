# 💼 Interview Q&A: Heart Failure Prediction Project

Below is a comprehensive list of interview questions and answers that may be asked when you present your heart failure machine learning project. These range from basic to advanced, covering everything from data preprocessing to model reasoning.

---

## 🧠 GENERAL PROJECT QUESTIONS

1. **What is the objective of this project?**  
To predict the likelihood of a heart failure event in patients using clinical data and compare multiple ML models for accuracy.

2. **Why did you choose this dataset?**  
It has a real-world medical application, small but clean data, and a binary classification problem — perfect for testing multiple supervised algorithms.

3. **What is the target variable?**  
`DEATH_EVENT` (0 = survived, 1 = died)

4. **What type of ML problem is this?**  
Binary classification using supervised learning.

## 🔍 DATA PREPROCESSING QUESTIONS

5. **Did you handle missing values?**  
Yes, but this dataset had no missing values.

6. **Why did you use only continuous features?**  
To avoid encoding and simplify scaling, also because they provide enough information for model training.

7. **Why did you scale your data?**  
To normalize the range of features. Models like SVM and KNN are sensitive to scale.

8. **Which scaler did you use and why?**  
StandardScaler — it transforms features to mean = 0 and standard deviation = 1.

## ⚙️ MODEL TRAINING QUESTIONS

9. **Why did you use these 6 specific models?**  
To test a range of algorithm types: linear, margin-based, instance-based, probabilistic, and ensemble methods.

10. **What was your best performing model and why?**  
Decision Tree (88.89% accuracy). Its structure fits small datasets well and it's easy to tune.

11. **How did you decide the value of `k` in KNN?**  
Used a loop from 1–50 and selected the `k` with highest test accuracy.

12. **Why use `criterion="entropy"` in Decision Tree?**  
Entropy uses information gain which is more precise in splitting compared to Gini.

13. **Why `max_depth=2`?**  
To avoid overfitting and keep the tree interpretable.

14. **Why use Naive Bayes for continuous data?**  
Used GaussianNB, which assumes features follow a normal distribution — suitable for continuous data.

15. **What metric did you use?**  
Accuracy (rounded to 4 decimals and shown as a percentage).

## 📊 VISUALIZATION & INSIGHT QUESTIONS

16. **How did you visualize model performance?**  
Using a barplot with Seaborn, model names on the x-axis, accuracy on y-axis.

17. **What insight did you get?**  
Simple models can perform as well or better than complex ones if data is clean and small.

---

## ⚠️ CHALLENGES & LIMITATIONS

18. **What were the challenges?**  
Small dataset, risk of overfitting, lack of class balance checking.

19. **What are the limitations of accuracy?**  
Accuracy ignores class imbalance. Need metrics like precision, recall, F1, ROC-AUC.

20. **Did you check for class imbalance?**  
Not yet — `value_counts()` on `DEATH_EVENT` will be used next.

---

## 🔁 IMPROVEMENT & FUTURE WORK

21. **How would you improve the project?**  
Add confusion matrix, ROC-AUC, cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning, and feature importance.

22. **Would you deploy this model? How?**  
Yes, using Streamlit or Flask and deploy via Render or Heroku.

23. **How is this useful in real life?**  
Helps doctors assess heart failure risk early and take action.

## 🔍 MODEL SELECTION & REASONING

24. **Why these six models?**  
They represent different algorithm families — helps understand strengths and weaknesses across methods.

25. **Why not use complex models like XGBoost or Neural Networks?**  
Dataset is small — complex models would likely overfit and add unnecessary complexity.

26. **Why no deep learning?**  
Too small a dataset. Deep learning needs lots of data and is better suited to images, text, etc.

27. **Why SVM instead of just Logistic Regression?**  
SVM maximizes the margin, potentially generalizes better. Logistic Regression is easier to interpret.

28. **Why not only use tree-based models?**  
I wanted to compare tree models with linear, probabilistic, and distance-based models for a broader view.

29. **Which model would you deploy?**  
Decision Tree or Random Forest — high accuracy and interpretability. Logistic Regression for transparency.

30. **How do you know your model isn’t overfitting?**  
Used test accuracy and limited model depth. Plan to add cross-validation for confirmation.

31. **If all models perform close, how do you choose?**  
By interpretability, training time, deployment simplicity, and consistency on validation sets.

## 💻 CODE & CONCEPTUAL QUESTIONS

32. **Why round accuracy to 4 decimals?**  
For clean and consistent display.

33. **What does `accuracy_score()` return?**  
A float between 0 and 1 — percentage of correct predictions.

34. **What’s the role of `plt.tight_layout()`?**  
To avoid overlapping of labels or elements in the plot.

---

## 🎯 SOFT SKILLS & STRATEGY

35. **What was your biggest learning from this project?**  
That simple models with proper preprocessing can beat complex ones, and visualization is key in communication.

36. **If given a new dataset, how would you approach it?**  
Clean → Explore → Preprocess → Baseline model → Evaluate → Improve → Visualize → Deploy
